# ecommerce_sales_analysis report

##Objective
The data for this E-Commerce Sales Analysis Project was obtained from Kaggle and comprised three separate relational datasets.

This report provides insights into e-commerce sales performance for an India based website. Findings are based on category, customer segments, geographic distribution, and temporal trends. 

###Key Findings
1.	Customer Segmentation:
o	A high proportion of customers are in the "At Risk" and "Potential Loyalist" segments, indicating opportunities for engagement and retention. Although the Loyal Customers represent a visibly strong portion of the Customer Segmentation there are opportunities for engagement.
o	The "Champions" and "Promising" segments represent a smaller proportion but may drive higher value.

2.	Category Performance:
o	Electronic items account for the largest quantities sold of products, followed by Clothing and Furniture.
o	Profit and order quantities vary significantly across sub-categories, indicating potential areas for optimization. Tables ran at a loss for the company along with some electronics, but most sub-category products performed well generating pleasing profit margins with electronics and clothing dominating profit generation.
3.	Geographic Insights:
o	Cities such as New Delhi and nearby regions show significant spending, highlighting key market areas for targeted marketing efforts. The top ten most profitable cities in descending order are as follows: Pune, Indore, Allahabad, Delhi, Kalkata, Udaipur, Thiruvananthapuram, Mumbai, Surat and Chandigarh.
4.	Monthly Trends:
o	Sales and profits peak in March and December, suggesting strong seasonality in demand.
o	Mid-year months show lower activity, presenting opportunities for promotional strategies.

###Recommendations

1.	Category Strategy:
o	Focus marketing efforts on high-performing categories like Electronics while identifying and addressing performance gaps in others, particularly furniture.
o	Analyse underperforming sub-categories like Trousers or Tables to adjust inventory or pricing strategies.
2.	Customer Retention:
o	Develop loyalty programs to convert "At Risk" customers into active buyers.
o	Personalize outreach for "Potential Loyalists" with targeted discounts or exclusive offers.
3.	Geographic Expansion:
o	Allocate more resources to high-spending cities while exploring emerging markets in nearby regions.
4.	Seasonal Promotions:
o	Leverage seasonal peaks by planning major sales events in March and December.
o	Implement mid-year campaigns to drive demand during slow months.
5.	Data Utilization:
o	Continuously analyse customer behaviour to refine segmentation strategies.
o	Use insights from monthly trends and sub-category performance to improve forecasting.

###Conclusion

The dashboard highlights opportunities for optimizing sales and customer engagement strategies. Focusing on high-performing categories, addressing retention gaps, and leveraging seasonality will help business owners maximize revenue. Continuous data-driven decisions are essential for sustained growth.
